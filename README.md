## Project Goal and Output:

### Neural Network Classifier with Scikit

Using the multi-label classifier dataset (categorized-comments.jsonl), fit a neural network classifier using scikit-learn to predict the comment category.Report the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Neural Network Classifier with Keras

Using the multi-label classifier dataset (categorized-comments.jsonl), fit a neural network classifier with Keras to predict the comment category. Report the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Classifying Images

Classify MSINT images using a convolutional neural network. Report the accuracy of your results.
